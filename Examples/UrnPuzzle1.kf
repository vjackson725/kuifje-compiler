# There are 100 balls in an urn, n (<= 100) of them are red and 100-n of them
# are green. n is sampled uniformly from the range 0..=100. You remove a ball
# (without replacement) from the urn; it is red. If you remove another ball
# from the urn, what is the probability it is red?

n <- uniform [0..100]

pick1 <- "red" [n/100] "green"

assume (pick1 == "red")

pick2 <- "red" [(n-1)/99] "green"
